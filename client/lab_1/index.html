<html><h1>WILLIAM YAI-AM Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

<h2>First, the basics.</h2>

<p>You need the following to build your website.</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>And other web development frameworks</li>
</ul>

<p>You should list your top 5 albums below. This is to show you know how to use a list element.</p>

<ol>
<li>Over It</li>
<li>It Was Divine</li>
<li>Ungodly Hour</li>
<li>Ctrl</li>
<li>Introspection</li>
</ol>

<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both.</em></strong></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br> Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Include the four images from the links and images tutorial below.</p>

<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

<img src='images/mochi.jpg' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>
<img src='images/mochi.png' alt='A mochi ball'/>
<img src='images/mochi.svg' alt='A mochi ball with BÃ©zier handles'/>
<img src='images/mochi.gif' alt='A dancing mochi ball'/>

<p><a href='https://github.com/wyaiam/INST377-Lab-Work'>Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.</a></p>

<p>If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
